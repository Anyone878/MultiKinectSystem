# MultiKinectSystem
Final project for the master's study.

If you want to run this program, you need to ensure you have at least one Kinect.

## Prepare
[Setup Kinect Body Tracking SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-setup) in ./deps

Install vcpkg and run `vcpkg install` in the project dir.

Prepare a checkerboard (5 * 3, 95mm each) pattern for calibration, if you have more than one Kinect.
